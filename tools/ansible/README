This directory contains some ansible script that we use to setup some
machines that we use for JonDoBrowser development.

To deploy some changes you need the ansible package to be installed on
your machine, and be able to log in with ssh as root on the machine(s)
where the changes need to be deployed.

You can then use one of the following makefile targets:

ansible-tbb-build:
  Deploy changes to the machine used by JonDoBrowser team members to do
  some JonDoBrowser builds.
